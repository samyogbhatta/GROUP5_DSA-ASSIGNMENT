# Smart Grid Optimization Using Genetic Algorithms

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a smart grid energy distribution optimization system using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and a Greedy baseline approach. The project addresses the multi-objective optimization problem of allocating power from three renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro) to 30 demand nodes over a 24-hour period, minimizing operational costs, transmission losses, and demand fulfillment penalties while respecting capacity constraints. The implementation leverages Python with libraries such as PyGAD, PyTorch, and CUDA for parallel processing to enhance computational efficiency.

The project is part of the **ITS66604 - Machine Learning and Parallel Computing** course assignment at Taylor's University for the May 2025 semester. It includes a detailed report (in the provided document) and Python code for running the optimization, analyzing performance, and visualizing results.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: Optimizes power allocation using PyGAD with serial and parallel implementations.
- **Greedy Baseline**: A deterministic approach that allocates power starting with the cheapest source.
- **Parallel Computing**: Utilizes PyTorch with CUDA for GPU-based fitness evaluation and multiprocessing for CPU tasks.
- **Visualizations**: Includes convergence plots, execution time comparisons, cost comparisons, and a correlation heatmap of the dataset.
- **Dataset**: A synthetic smart grid dataset with demand, capacity, cost, and line loss data for 30 nodes, 3 sources, and 24 hours.

## Prerequisites
To run the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas pygad torch matplotlib seaborn
  ```
- A CUDA-enabled GPU (optional, for parallel GA with PyTorch).
- Access to a system with multiple CPU cores for multiprocessing (optional, improves parallel GA performance).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samyogbhatta/group6_MLPC-grpAssignment.git
   cd grp6GA(MLPC)
   ```
2.. Ensure the dataset (`smart_grid_dataset.csv`) is in the project directory or generated by the code.

## Usage
1. **Generate or Load Dataset**:
   The code includes a function to generate a synthetic dataset (`generate_smart_grid_dataset`). Alternatively, place your own `smart_grid_dataset.csv` in the project root with columns: `Hour`, `Node`, `Demand_MW`, `Solar_Capacity_MW`, `Wind_Capacity_MW`, `Hydro_Capacity_MW`, `Line_Loss_Factor`, `Cost_Solar`, `Cost_Wind`, `Cost_Hydro`.

2. **Run the Optimization**:
   Execute the main script to run the Greedy baseline, serial GA, and parallel GA, and generate visualizations:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The script will:
   - Run the Greedy algorithm to establish a baseline cost.
   - Run the GA in serial and parallel modes (using PyGAD and PyTorch).
   - Output a summary comparison table with execution times and fitness scores.
   - Generate plots: convergence curves, execution time comparison, cost comparison, and correlation heatmap.

3. **Output**:
   - **Console Output**: Displays a summary table comparing execution times and costs/fitness scores for Greedy, GA Parallel, and GA Serial methods.
   - **Visualizations**:
     - `Convergence Curve`: Plots fitness over 100 generations for serial and parallel GAs.
     - `Execution Time Comparison`: Bar plot comparing runtimes of Greedy, GA Parallel, and GA Serial.
     - `Cost Comparison`: Bar plot comparing total costs/fitness scores.
     - `Correlation Heatmap`: Heatmap of Pearson correlation coefficients for dataset variables.
   - **Files**: Plots are displayed and can be saved by modifying the code (e.g., adding `plt.savefig()`).

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: Main script containing the dataset generation, GA implementation, Greedy baseline, and visualization code.
- `smart_grid_dataset.csv` (optional): Synthetic dataset file, generated if not provided.
- `README.md`: This file, providing project overview and instruction

## Notes
- **Dataset**: The dataset is synthetic, with random values for demand (50–200 MW), capacities (Solar: 0–100 MW, Wind: 0–150 MW, Hydro: 0–120 MW), line loss factors (0.05–0.15), and costs (Solar: $0.08–0.12/kWh, Wind: $0.06–0.10/kWh, Hydro: $0.04–0.08/kWh).
- **Parallelization**: The parallel GA uses PyTorch with CUDA for fitness evaluation and PyGAD's multiprocessing for CPU tasks. Serial GA may outperform parallel GA for smaller datasets due to overheads (e.g., GPU communication latency).
- **Performance**: The Greedy algorithm is fastest (<1 second) but suboptimal. Serial GA achieves better fitness (-9,055,729) than parallel GA (-9,180,624) in ~16 seconds vs. ~196 seconds, respectively, due to parallel overheads.
- **Scalability**: The code is designed to scale with larger grids (e.g., more nodes or sources) using Dask for distributed computing (proposed but not implemented).
